This is  a separate Menu repository to re-do the project from the ground up.
To run:

*  Download the Menu_Beta.exe file to the "Downloads" directory
*  Navigate via Powershell to the "Downloads" directory
*  Run it via .\Menu_Beta.exe command 


For now it only works with Windows ( Powershell in particular )
